Predicting Obesity

Background
This project is for my data science master's capstone course at Merrimack College

Research Question
Can we classify people into different BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese) based on demographic, dietary, questionnaire, and examination data?  Which features play the biggest role in making this decision? Are we able to estimate the probabilities for each category to detect early signs, helping with prevention? 

Hypothesis
Demographic, dietary, questionnaire, and examination data will accurately predict the class of someone's BMI.

Prediction
Dietary features, including total sugar, carbs, protein, energy, dietary fiber, total fat, and more, will be some of the most important features when predicting obesity risk.
