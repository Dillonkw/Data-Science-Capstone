Defined Research Question  
Can we predict which adults have a healthy BMI primarily based on their nutrient intake, along with other demographic, laboratory, and questionnaire variables from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey? Which nutrients play the biggest role in making this decision?

Hypothesis  
Nutrition intake, along with demographic, questionnaire, and laboratory variables, will be able to predict if an adult has a healthy BMI because these variables are indicators of dietary behaviors, lifestyle patterns, and medical history, which affect a person's weight.

Prediction  
Adults who have a balanced nutritional intake, a strong lifestyle, and a stable medical history will have a healthy BMI. Variables like protein, fiber, fats, sugar, and micronutrients will be the most influential when predicting healthy BMI.
